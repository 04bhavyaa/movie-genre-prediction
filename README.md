## Movie Genre Prediction

This project aims to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary. Leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques, the system processes textual data and applies various models to achieve accurate predictions.

### Tech Stack:

- Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NLTK
- Models: Logistic Regression, Linear SVC, Random Forest, Naive Bayes
- Best Performing Model: Ensemble of Linear SVC and Logistic Regression with an accuracy of 58.88% on the validation set.

### Key Takeaways:

- Ensemble models outperformed individual models due to combined decision-making.
- Fine-tuning hyperparameters significantly improved accuracy for individual models.
- Preprocessing steps like lemmatization and scaling were essential for handling text data.
